# Cifar10
The Tensorflow implementation of some models including the ResNet, ResNeXt, WideResNet, PyramidNet, etc. on the Cifar-10 or Cifar-100 dataset. There are also some novel augmentation and regularization methods such as Mixup and autoAugmentation and ShakeDrop in this project. The Code is clear to read and understand, and you can learn some useful Python and TensorFlow skills including multiprocessing, pyplot, PIL, and how to feed the network with tf.data.Dataset, how to accelerate the training with multiGPUs, how to make a checkpoint and restore it, and so on.
## Usage
### Dataset
Download the python version [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz) or [CIFAR-100](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz) dataset from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html and unzip the dataset.

For convenience, the project doesn't use the original dataset as most other projects do, however, the dataset will be firstly converted to PNG images that every image contains its label in the filename, e.g. the image "test0_3.png" represents the 1st image of the testing dataset with which the label is 3. It is memory efficient if we can dynamically parse the images while needed, e.g. using the map function in tf.data.Dataset. However, it doesn't waste too much time as we can use the multiprocessing to parallelly prepare the datasets for the next epoch while training.

You can do it with the command below in the linux shell. Note that the project doesn't provide the command line parameters, you should config them in the corresponding files. You can check whether the images is correctly saved after the command.

`$ python cifar_to_png.py`
### Training
As mentioned above, the command line parameters are not provided, but you can easily config the parameters in the begining of the codes. There are two versions of training files, the single/no GPU one and the multiGPUs one. The single/no GPU one, named `train.py`, can be executed without any GPUs but just CPUs (although it's very slow), or with only one GPU. On the contrary, the multiGPUs one, named `train_multigpus.py`, must executed with at least one GPU, with data parallelism, which means that all GPUs have the same compute graph. Both two codes would saved the best result as a checkpoint while training, and you can test or retrain the model with a checkpoint by running the `test.py` or `train_with_ckpt.py` and its multiGPUs version `train_with_ckpt_multigpus.py`, respectively.  

For simplicity, run the command line bewlow in the shell, Windows DOS supported as well, and *tensorflow*, *numpy*, *PIL*, *matplotlib*, *multiprocessing*, *cPickle*, *re* etc. are needed.  

`$ python train.py`
